		<h3>Plot Overview</h3>
		<p>Stanley Yelnats, a boy who has bad luck due to a curse placed on his great- great-grandfather, is sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile detention camp, for a crime he did not commit. Stanley and the other boys at the camp are forced to dig large holes in the dirt every day. Stanley eventually realizes that they are digging these holes because the Warden is searching for something. As Stanley continues to dig holes and meet the other boys at the camp, the narrator intertwines three separate stories to reveal why Stanley's family has a curse and what the Warden is looking for.</p>
		<p>When he was a boy, Stanley's great-great-grandfather, Elya Yelnats, received a pig from Madame Zeroni, a gypsy, in exchange for a promise. Elya's promise was that after the pig grew strong he would carry Madame Zeroni, who only had one leg, up a mountain and sing her a song that she had taught him. After becoming disillusioned with the girl he thought he loved, however, Elya hops a boat to America, forgetting his promise to Madame Zeroni. Elya marries and has a child in America and always thinks about Madame Zeroni, who he believes has cursed him because of his failure to fulfill his promise. He knows that Madame Zeroni's son lives in America, but Elya never finds him.</p>
		<p>One hundred and ten years before Stanley arrives at Camp Green Lake, the town of Green Lake is a beautiful place where peach trees bloom throughout the spring. In this Texas town, the schoolteacher, Katherine Barlow, falls in love with Sam, the onion seller. Sam sells onions to eat and to use for medicinal purposes. While Katherine and Sam are alive, racism is institutionalized in the United States and it is against the law for a black man to kiss a white woman. Because Sam is black and Katherine is white, the people in the town become irate when they find that Katherine and Sam have kissed. Charles, or Trout, Walker, the richest man in town has always wanted to marry Katherine. He is already mad that Katherine does not wish to go out with him so when he finds out that she is in love with Sam he gathers the townspeople to burn the schoolhouse and attack Sam. Katherine seeks help from the local sheriff but instead finds that the sheriff, who makes lewd advances towards her, also wants to kill Sam. Katherine and Sam attempt to escape but their boat is destroyed while only half way across the lake and Sam is killed. Katherine is driven mad by her grief and becomes an outlaw known as Kissin' Kate Barlow. Her name refers to the fact that she kisses the men she kills, leaving a lipstick imprint of her lips on their faces. In her twenty years of robbing people in the west, she happens to rob Stanley's great- grandfather while he is on his way from New York to California. She buries Stanley's great-grandfather's money somewhere and even though Charles Walker and his wife Linda try to torture her into revealing its location, Kate dies before anyone can find out where the money is hidden. After the day that Sam is killed, rain stops falling on Green Lake and the lake dries up.</p>

		<h3>Important Quotations Explained</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>"A lot of people don't believe in curses. A lot of people don't believe in yellow-spotted lizards either, but if one bites you, it doesn't make a difference whether you believe in it or not"<p>This is a statement from the narrator which implies that regardless of whether Stanley's family or the reader believes in curses, the bad luck that they are the recipients of is undeniable. And, just as the lizard's bite is deadly, so is the supposed curse that Stanley's family is under.</p></li>
			<li>"This is a statement from the narrator which implies that regardless of whether Stanley's family or the reader believes in curses, the bad luck that they are the recipients of is undeniable. And, just as the lizard's bite is deadly, so is the supposed curse that Stanley's family is under."<p>This statement describes Stanley's development at Camp Green Lake. Although Stanley is used to being picked on, he exhibits no sympathy for Zero when Zero reveals that he cannot read. Instead of trying to help Zero, Stanley instead decides to reserve his energy for himself. This is not purely Stanley's fault, the tough people that he is surrounded by have influenced him and now he is becoming like them.</p></li>
			<li>"If only, if only," the woodpecker sighs, "The BARK on the tree was just a little bit softer." While the wolf waits below, hungry and lonely, He cries to the moo-oo-oon, "If only, if only."<p>This is not so much an important quote as it is a recurring quote in the book. Although slightly changed by each person, these are the basic lyrics to the song that Madame Zeroni taught Elya Yelnats and that was subsequently passed down through generations until it reached Stanley and Zero. The lyrics of the song show that even wolves and birds wish that life was easier. It is a fitting song to be sung by the Yelnats and Zeroni families, two families that have had bad luck and hard lives.</p></li>
