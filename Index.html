	<h1>Invisibility</h1>
	<p>Users can render themselves unseen by the naked eye and become invisible in visible spectrum. The user can move about an environment unseen by others and act without being observed. Some users can choose to let certain people see them, while staying invisible to others.</p>
	<p>You need great concentration to stay invisible for a long time.</p>
	<h2>What will you do with the superpower?</h2>
	<p>I want to hide from people who decieve me and the people who bully me.</p>
