			<dt>JPEG</dt>
				<dd> is an acronym for the Joint Photographic Experts Group, which created the standard.</dd>
			<dt>PNG</dt>
				<dd>is as acronym for Portable Network Graphics</dd>
				<dd>is a raster graphics file format that supports lossless data compression.</dd>
				<dd>was created as an improved, non-patented replacement for Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), and is the most widely used lossless image compression format on the Internet.</dd>
			<dt>GIF</dt>
				<dd>is an acronym for Graphics Interchange Format which created the standard.</dd>
				<dd> is a bitmap image format that was developed by US-based software writer Steve Wilhite while working at the internet service provider CompuServe in 1987 and has since come into widespread usage on the World Wide Web due to its wide support and portability.</dd>
				<dd>The format supports up to 8 bits per pixel for each image, allowing a single image to reference its own palette of up to 256 different colors chosen from the 24-bit RGB color space. It also supports animations and allows a separate palette of up to 256 colors for each frame. These palette limitations make the GIF format less suitable for reproducing color photographs and other images with continuous color, but it is well-suited for simpler images such as graphics or logos with solid areas of color.</dd>
			<dt>Primary storage</dt>
				<dd>A temporary storage, its very volatile, its relatively expensive.</dd>
			<dt>Secondary storage</dt>
				<dd>A permanent storage(relatively), it's non-volatile, it's cheap and slow.</dd>
			<dt>PDF</dt>
				<dd>Acronym for Portable Document Format.</dd>
				<dd>is a file format used to present documents in a manner independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems.</dd>
				<dd> Each PDF file encapsulates a complete description of a fixed-layout flat document, including the text, fonts, graphics, and other information needed to display it.</dd>
